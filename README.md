# Knock on Wood

A simple yet delightful web application that allows users to simulate the action of knocking on wood for those moments when you don't want to "jinx" something. Crafted with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the power of GSAP for animations.

**Live Site:** [Knock on Wood](https://knock-on-wood.netlify.app)

## Features

- **Interactive Experience**: Click to knock on the wood and see a visual "knock" pop-up.
- **Sound Effects**: Each click is accompanied by a satisfying knock sound effect, adding to the realism.
- **Knock Counter**: Keeps track of your knocks with a counter, which persists between sessions using local storage.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

## How to Use

Visit the website and simply click anywhere on the wooden background to "knock." The counter at the bottom will keep track of your knocks.
